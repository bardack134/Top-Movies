## Description

Movie Library Manager is a web application developed with Flask that allows users to manage a movie library. Users can add, edit, and delete movies from the database, as well as search for movie information using The Movie Database (TMDb) API . The application uses SQLAlchemy for database management and Flask-WTF for form validation.

## Tools Used

-- Flask: Used to create the web application and handle routing.  (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/)

-- SQLAlchemy: Used for database management and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the SQLite database. (https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)

-- Flask-WTF: Used for form handling and validation. (https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.x/quickstart/)

-- Flask-Bootstrap: Used to integrate Bootstrap for better styling and layout of the web pages.(https://bootstrap-flask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

-- The Movie Database (TMDb) API: Used to search for and retrieve detailed movie information. (https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/finding-data)

-- SQLite: Used as the database to store movie details.
